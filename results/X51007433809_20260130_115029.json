      "explanation": "The evaluation assessed the generated insights against the invoice data for completeness and factual accuracy. \n\n1. **Completeness**: I identified 11 key data points in the source invoice: Vendor Name, Invoice Number, Date, Payment Type, Line Item Description, Quantity, Unit Price, Subtotal, GST Amount/Rate, Total, and Discounts. The insights covered 8 of these points. They failed to mention the Vendor Name (Syarikat Kam Lai Seong Sdn Bhd) and the Invoice Number (INV-37002). Furthermore, while a line item was mentioned, its actual description ('5lt Nippon Zinc Chromate') was misidentified as 'OPENITEM2', effectively missing the correct line item data.\n\n2. **Factual Accuracy**: Four out of five insights are fully factual. Insight 3 is classified as 'partial' due to two errors: it hallucinated the item name as 'OPENITEM2' and incorrectly stated that the subtotal before tax was RM 190.00. According to the GST summary, RM 190.00 is the final total including tax, while the subtotal (taxable amount) is RM 179.25. All other insights regarding payment type, GST rates, discounts, and transaction dates are accurate.",

      "explanation": "The reconciliation between Source A (Multimodal Vision) and Source B (OCR) shows a very high level of agreement across nearly all key data points including vendor details, invoice numbers, financial totals, and tax breakdowns. Both sources correctly identified the Vendor Name, Address, Contact Information, GST Registration Number, Invoice Number, Date, and all summary financial figures (Subtotal, GST, Rounding, and Total). The only significant mismatch occurs in the 'Line Item Description'. Source A extracted the text 'OPEN ITEM: 5lt Nippon Zinc Chromate' correctly, whereas the OCR in Source B struggled with the line item formatting, merging the quantity with the description ('OPENITEM2') and misreading 'Nippon' as 'oddin'. Additionally, minor formatting differences in dates (colons vs. periods) and spaces in the address are treated as matches per the instructions.",
