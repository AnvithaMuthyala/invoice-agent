However, several critical 'metadata' fields such as the Invoice Number, Date of Issue, Seller Address, Seller Tax ID, Seller IBAN, Client Address, and Client Tax ID are entirely absent. Factually, five out of the seven insights are correct. Insight 4 contains a completely hallucinated average price calculation ($47.99), whereas the true average net price is approximately $23.45 (per type) or $22.13 (per unit). Insight 5 correctly identifies the price and quantity for Item 7 but incorrectly ranks it as the 'third most expensive' item; it is the second most expensive by unit price and the most expensive by total net worth.",
